ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @essihuhtanen! I'm studying for my master's degree in computer sciences in University of Tampere.

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in all things web! Front-end, back-end, full-stack, you name it. 

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying software design and testing and improving my web development skills by working on a project called HoruksenMonokkeli.
